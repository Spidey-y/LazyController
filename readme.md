# Hello there!

I hate when i share my pc screen to tv to watch a movie while laying on my bed and i have to get up to pause or change the volume. So i made this app to control my pc from my phone. It's a simple app that allows you to control your pc from your phone. It's a web app that you can access from your phone's browser. It's a work in progress and i'm adding features as i need them. Feel free to contribute or suggest features. Also i want to make it a free alternative to to stream deck.

The app is built using flask and flutter, don't worry no need to build or anything, just run the server and open the link on your phone's browser or pc browser or whatever.

# Head's up

1. Both your phone and pc must be connected to the same network.
2. The web app will take arround 5 seconds or so depending on your network to load, only the first time you open it.
3. Dont judge the design, it obviously wasn't my priority ðŸ˜‚

# How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python start.py
```

PS: I recoommend using a virtual environment just to keep things clean

# TODO

1. add keyboard, shortcuts/macros (copy/paste, undo/redo, open app, etc)
2. add mouse (tochpad)
3. improve the design and make it customizable
